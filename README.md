NetSpeed is a network speed testing and analysis tool that I originally built within my first month of programming. As one of my earliest full-scale projects, this program holds a special place in my journey â€” making it a legacy project.

Since creating NetSpeed, I've significantly improved my coding skills. For example, I now focus heavily on writing efficient, structured code using classes and better design principles. Because of this, modifying or expanding this version would be less efficient than developing a newer version from scratch.

Key Features

Performs interval-based speed tests

Tracks speed trends over time (daily/weekly insights)

Identifies optimal network usage times

Provides real-time network performance insights

Why NetSpeed is Special

Legacy Project: NetSpeed reflects my growth as a programmer and shows what I was capable of in my early stages.

Functional Foundation: Despite being one of my first major programs, NetSpeed still effectively handles its purpose as a reliable network performance tracker.
